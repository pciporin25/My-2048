#My 2048

Developed based on a [YouTube tutorial]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tveTp3w3Wsg) posted by [Amadev](https://github.com/PavlyukVadim).  Modified by Peter Ciporin.  Fixed game-refresh functionality, changed fill-style for empty tiles to comprise an image of the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia (where I am currently spending my semester abroad).  Also added an image to the page background.  Based on the original [2048 Game](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) developed by [Gabriel Cirulli](https://gabrielecirulli.com/).[Sydney Opera House Image Source](https://whatson.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/events/sydney-opera-house-the-opera).
